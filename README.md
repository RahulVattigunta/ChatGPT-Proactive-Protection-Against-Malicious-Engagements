# ChatGPT-Proactive-Protection-Against-Malicious-Engagements

Project Overview
Online communication platforms, including social media, forums, and chat applications, are essential for modern interactions. However, they also pose challenges in regulating content and preventing malicious engagements such as harassment, hate speech, and toxic behavior. This project develops an AI-powered system that proactively detects and mitigates harmful interactions in real-time using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as GPT and BERT.

The system leverages transformer-based models to analyze text-based conversations, identify potentially harmful content, and take immediate action, such as notifying moderators or restricting users. It utilizes a pretrained NLP model fine-tuned with a diverse dataset of online conversations, ensuring high accuracy in identifying toxic language while reducing bias.
