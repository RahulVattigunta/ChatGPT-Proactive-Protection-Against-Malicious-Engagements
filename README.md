# ChatGPT-Proactive-Protection-Against-Malicious-Engagements

# Project Overview

Online communication platforms, including social media, forums, and chat applications, are essential for modern interactions. However, they also pose challenges in regulating content and preventing malicious engagements such as harassment, hate speech, and toxic behavior. This project develops an AI-powered system that proactively detects and mitigates harmful interactions in real-time using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as GPT and BERT.

The system leverages transformer-based models to analyze text-based conversations, identify potentially harmful content, and take immediate action, such as notifying moderators or restricting users. It utilizes a pretrained NLP model fine-tuned with a diverse dataset of online conversations, ensuring high accuracy in identifying toxic language while reducing bias.

# Key Features
- **Real-Time Toxicity Detection:** Uses **GPT/BERT-based NLP** models to analyze and classify conversations for malicious content.
- **Automated Moderation:** Flags harmful interactions and can take immediate actions, such as issuing warnings or restricting user access.
- **Dataset Training & Optimization:** Incorporates a large dataset of online dialogues, ensuring a robust and adaptable system.
- **Ethical AI Considerations:** Implements bias mitigation strategies to ensure fair and transparent moderation.

# System Components
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Gathers and cleanses chat data to train the toxicity detection model.
- **Machine Learning Model Training:** Fine-tunes transformer-based NLP models to recognize and classify toxic interactions.
- **Web-Based Moderation Interface:** Provides an intuitive dashboard for administrators to monitor flagged content.
- **User Reporting & Feedback:** Allows users to report content, improving system accuracy through continuous learning.
